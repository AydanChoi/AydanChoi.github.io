    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and various environmental impacts.

    <h3>Effects of Climate Change</h3>
    <p>
        The effects of climate change are far-reaching and diverse, impacting ecosystems, human health, and economies worldwide. Some of the most significant effects include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rising sea levels</li>
        <li>Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events</li>
        <li>Changes in precipitation patterns</li>
        <li>Loss of biodiversity</li>
        <li>Impacts on agriculture and food security</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mitigation and Adaptation</h3>
    <p>
        To address climate change, both mitigation and adaptation strategies are essential. Mitigation involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks, while adaptation focuses on adjusting to the current and expected impacts of climate change. Some key strategies include:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
    <p>
        - Transitioning to renewable energy sources<br>
        - Improving energy efficiency<br>
        - Protecting and restoring forests
    </p>
    <p><strong>Adaptation:</strong></p>
    <p>
        - Building resilient infrastructure<br>
        - Developing drought-resistant crops<br>
        - Implementing early warning systems for extreme weather events
    </p>
